# **Eat Sleep And Try Not To Die - A Game by Yehonatan P. Koritny**

## A new way to get frustrated 
### Really early in development. Doing it mostly for fun.
Written in GDscript using the Godot game engine.
Animation and pixel art are all made in Aseprite.

The premise of the game is to make sure your little character has all his needs satisfied.
If one of your needs gets to zero - you die.

At advanced stages of the game, you have to satisfy a big amount of needs simultaneously
while, for example, the fridge starts running away, you go blind for a couple of seconds etc...
